# Groff / Troff documents
As I started to get into using `groff` for typesetting and formatting 
simple projects like lab reports and work sheets,
I found the documentation for `groff` and its companion programs (`tbl`/`eqn`/`grap` etc...) 
to be all over the place.
Thus I'm going to try to gather all the useful information that I found on this page.

I will possibly even post some stuff that I found out when trying to get some "advanced" 
features working in `groff` (see: [learnings](learnings)).

I am no expert though. Not at all.

## Groff 2018
[groff - The GNU implementation of troff](ressources/groff2018.pdf)

*Author(s): Trent. A Fisher, Werner Lemberg*

Great, extensive overview over the GNU implementation of troff (=`groff`) 
in its most recent version 1.22.4.
This >250 page documentation covers everything from the history, to the 
command options to the basic formatting macros and even dives into an
overview over arguably the most useful macro-package `MS`.
It's long, for sure, but search it for whatever term is on your mind, 
and you will likely find proper explanations or at least hints and directions
for what you need.
I actually wonder though if it was typeset in `groff`... it looks a lot like LaTeX to me. :)

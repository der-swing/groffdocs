# Groff / Troff documents
As I started to get into using `groff` for typesetting and formatting 
simple projects like lab reports and work sheets,
I found the documentation for `groff` and its companion programs (`tbl`/`eqn`/`grap` etc...) 
to be all over the place.
Thus I'm going to try to gather all the useful information that I found on this page.

I will possibly even post some stuff that I found out when trying to get some "advanced" 
features working in `groff` (see: [learnings](learnings))
I am no expert though. Not at all.
